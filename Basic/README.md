### Java.lang.Double.isNan() Method
The java.lang.Double.isNan() method returns true if this Double value is a Not-a-Number (NaN), false otherwise.

[NaN (Not a Number) in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nan-not-number-java/)   
“NaN” stands for “not a number”. “Nan” is produced if a floating point operation has some input parameters that cause the operation to produce some undefined result. For example, 0.0 divided by 0.0 is arithmetically undefined. Finding out the square root of a negative number too is undefined.
