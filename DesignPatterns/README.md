# Design Pattern
Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development.

## What is Gang of Four (GOF)?
A book titled **Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software**
These authors are collectively known as Gang of Four (GOF)  

## Types of Design Patterns
* Creational Patterns  
These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.  
    * [Singleton Pattern](./CreationalDesignPatterns/SingletonPattern)
    * [Factory Pattern](./CreationalDesignPatterns/FactoryPattern)
    * [Abstract Factory Pattern](./CreationalDesignPatterns/AbstractFactoryPattern)
    * [Builder Pattern](./CreationalDesignPatterns/BuilderPattern)
    * [Prototype Pattern](./CreationalDesignPatterns/PrototypePattern)

* Structural Patterns  
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.  
    * [Adapter Pattern](./StructuralDesignPatterns/AdapterPattern)
    * Composite Pattern
    * Proxy Pattern
    * Flyweight Pattern
    * Facade Pattern
    * Bridge Pattern
    * Decorator Pattern

* Behavioral Patterns  
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
Template Method Pattern
    * Mediator Pattern
    * Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    * Observer Pattern
    * Strategy Pattern
    * Command Pattern
    * State Pattern
    * Visitor Pattern
    * Interpreter Pattern
    * Iterator Pattern
    * Memento Pattern
